## 1. Preparation: Sync with the Hub

First, enable the extension.

1.  Open [VoiceMux Hub](https://hub.knc.jp) on your PC.
2.  As soon as the site opens, your secure credentials will be automatically synced to this extension.
3.  Click the **VoiceMux icon (microphone stand mark)** in the top right of your browser.
4.  If you see "Ready to Pair!" and a QR code, you're all set!

> 💡 **Tip**: "Pin" the icon to your toolbar for instant access to the QR code.

## 2. Connect: Pair with Your Smartphone

1.  Scan the displayed **QR code** with your smartphone's camera.

Your smartphone and PC are now connected via a private channel protected by strong End-to-End Encryption (E2EE).

## 3. Usage: Talk to Your Phone

The best part of VoiceMux is using **"Gboard" or "iPhone Voice Dictation"** directly on your PC.

1.  On your PC, click into any text input field (ChatGPT, Gmail, etc.) where you want to type.
2.  Tap the input area on your phone to bring up the keyboard.
3.  Press the **"Microphone button"** on your keyboard and speak to your phone.
4.  When you stop speaking... your words will appear directly at your PC's cursor position!

## 4. Advance: Grow Your Dictionary

VoiceMux Hub helps you fix common misrecognitions of technical terms or names.

*   **Error Correction**: Fixing text in the Hub editor teaches the AI to be smarter next time.
*   **Prompt Generation**: Click **"🪄 Fix Errors & Generate Prompts"** at the bottom of the extension to open the Hub and optimize your input for AI assistants.

## 5. Privacy & Security

VoiceMux prioritizes your privacy.
*   **Private Data**: Your text is encrypted directly between your phone and PC. Not even our servers can read it.
*   **Offline Cache**: Once synced, you don't need to open the Hub site anymore. Just click the extension icon to start pairing instantly using cached credentials.

## 6. Troubleshooting

*   **No QR Code**: Try refreshing [VoiceMux Hub](https://hub.knc.jp) and then click the extension icon again.
*   **Text Not Appearing**: Make sure you've clicked inside a text field on your PC and that the cursor is active.
