# VoiceMux Bridge User Guide 🛰️

Welcome to VoiceMux Bridge!
This extension acts as a bridge between your smartphone's familiar keyboard and your desktop AI agents (Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.), allowing you to input text with the speed of thought.

No complex setup required. Let's take the first step together with this guide.

---

> ⚠️ **Important: Initial Setup Note**
> 
> After installing or updating VoiceMux Bridge, the extension will not work on tabs that were already open (like ChatGPT or Gemini).
> 
> To ensure it works correctly, **please "Refresh (Reload)" the website page you wish to use.**

## 1. Setup: Connect your Smartphone (Pairing)

First, securely connect your PC and smartphone.

1.  Click the **VoiceMux icon (microphone stand)** in the top right of your PC browser.
2.  A QR code will appear. Scan it with your **smartphone camera**.
3.  Once the dedicated page opens on your phone, you're ready!

**Connected!** Your smartphone and PC are now linked via a private channel protected by strong encryption (E2EE).

---

## 2. Usage: Speak into your Phone

The best part of VoiceMux is using your phone's native **voice input (Gboard, iOS dictation)** directly on your PC.

1.  Open your preferred AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) on your PC.
2.  Tap the input field on your smartphone to bring up the keyboard.
3.  Press the **microphone button** on your keyboard and speak into your phone.
4.  Once you stop, your words will instantly appear in the input field on your PC!

> 💡 **Tip**: This app relays any text entered on your phone. Beyond voice input, you can also use flick input or copy-paste text from your phone to your PC.

## 3. Freedom: Use on Any Site

VoiceMux works on sites beyond AI (internal systems, blogs, etc.).

1.  While on the site you want to use, click the **VoiceMux icon** once on your PC.
2.  This enables VoiceMux to detect the input field on that specific page.

*If a site doesn't work as expected, you can configure custom settings in the [Options] page.*

---

## 4. Privacy & Security

VoiceMux prioritizes your privacy.
*   **Your text is private**: Data is encrypted end-to-end between your phone and PC. Not even the relay server can read your content.
*   **Avoid passwords**: While secure, we recommend typing sensitive passwords directly on your PC rather than via smartphone.

---

## 5. Troubleshooting

*   **QR code won't appear**: Refresh the browser tab and try clicking the icon again.
*   **Text isn't appearing**: Ensure you have clicked the input field on your PC so the cursor is blinking.
